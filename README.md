# Project Proposal
Design a interactive dashboard that explores a data scientist salaries dataset from a source such as kaggle.com. Some questions we will ask of the data are: How has average salary changed overtime? Which countries have highest paying data science jobs? Is remote work increasing/decreasing over time? Which countries have the most remote work available?
