# Project Proposal
Design a interactive dashboard that explores a data scientist salaries dataset from a source such as kaggle.com. Some questions we will ask of the data are: How has average salary changed overtime? Which countries have highest paying data science jobs? Is remote work increasing/decreasing over time? Which countries have the most remote work available?

# How To Use
 * TEXT and IMAGES HERE
# Mapping Data Science Salaries
 * TEXT and IMAGES HERE
# Data Science Salaries over time
 * A time series analysis allows us to visualize the data over time.
 * Our data ranges from 2020 up until the beginning of 2023
 ### Charts

* Both line graphs are interactive and will update their data depending on the selected country
* As the charts show, the overall trend is supports an increase in average salary overtime and a decrease in remote work opportunities
* The bar chart shows a comparison of the change in salaries from 2020-2023
  * Only countries with data entries in 2020 and 2023 are included in the bar chart
  * Canada has the larget increase in salary ($82,944), while Germany had the largest decrease ($35,022)

# By Job Title

* Base on the chart shown below, Data Science Tech Lead have the highest salary among other job title with $375k and the lowest salary is Power BI Developer with $5409. This visualization show us the the salary for each job title.

* This visualization show us the job title with the remote work percentage.
